## Installation & Setup

### Running on macOS
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rnichi1/HabitFin.git
   cd HabitFin

2. Open the project in Xcode:
open/create Config.xcconfig
Add GPT_API_KEY and set it to your API key.

3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a real device (recommended for OCR functionality).

### Running on iOS (Real Device)

    Ensure your device is connected to your Mac.
    Select your device in Xcode and click Run.

### Running on Linux or Windows

    HabitFin is designed for iOS/macOS due to SwiftUI not being useable on other platforms.
                            
##Â OCR Features

OCR functionality relies on Vision framework, which requires a real iOS device to operate. The simulator will not support OCR features. Ensure the app has permission to access the camera for scanning receipts.
